// Values and Variables
// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions) 
// 2. Log their values to the console

const country = "The United States";
const continent = "North America";
let population = 328; // listed as the nearest whole number in millions

console.log(`The country ${country} is located on the continent of ${continent} and the population is currently estimated at around ${population} million people.`);
