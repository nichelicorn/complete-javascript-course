// üìù Values and Variables
// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions) 
// 2. Log their values to the console

const country = "The United States";
const continent = "North America";
let population = 328; // listed as the nearest whole number in millions

console.log(`The country ${country} is located on the continent of ${continent}. The population is currently estimated at around ${population} million people.`);

// üìù Data Types
// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable 'language', but don't assign it any value yet.
// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language' to the console.

const isIsland = false;
let language;

console.log(`Is ${country} an island? ${isIsland}! The main language spoken is ${language}.`);

// üìù let, const, and var
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some countries have multiple languages, but just choose one) 
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const. ‚úÖ
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

language = "English";
// should now interpolate a string instead of `undefined`
console.log(`Is ${country} an island? ${isIsland}! The main language spoken is ${language}.`);

// isIsland = true;
// Uncaught TypeError: invalid assignment to const 'isIsland'
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Invalid_const_assignment
// cannot reassign a `const` variable; these values can not be reassigned (they are NOT immutable, according to MDN)

// üìù Basic Operators
// 1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, then how many people would live in each half? 
let halfPopulation = population / 2;
console.log("the population of two halves <>>>", halfPopulation);

// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console 
population++;
console.log("increased population <>>>", population);

// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than Finland? 
let compToFinland = population >= 6;
console.log(`Is the population of ${country} greater than that of Finland's 6 million?   `, compToFinland);

// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country have less people than the average country? 
let avgPopulation = 33;
console.log(`Is the population of ${country} greater than the average country's population of 33 million?   `, population >= avgPopulation);

// 5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description' which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak portuguese' 
let description = "Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak Portuguese.";
console.log("string format <>>>", description);

// üìù Strings and Template Literals 
// 1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time using the template literal syntax 
let euroCountry = "Portugal";
let euroPop = 11;
let euroLanguage = "Portuguese";
description = `${euroCountry} is in Europe, and its ${euroPop} million people speak ${euroLanguage}.`;
console.log("template literal format <>>>", description);

// üìù Coding Challenge #1
console.log("üß™ coding challenge #1");

// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: 
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter). 
// Your tasks: 
// ‚àö 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions) 
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. 

// Test data: 
// ¬ß Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall. 
// ¬ß Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall. 
 
// GOOD LUCK üòÄ
