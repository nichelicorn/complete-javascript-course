# Project 2 : Modal window

## 79. Project 2 : Modal window
* modal element is already set in the HTML; starts with a `hidden` class
* using `.querySelector(".classname")` will only select the *first* element with that class
* to select multiple elements with the same class, use `.querySelectorAll()`, and can then utilize an iterator to assign individual selectors
* don't need curly braces for single command lines in `for` loops, `if / else` statements, arrow functions, etc
