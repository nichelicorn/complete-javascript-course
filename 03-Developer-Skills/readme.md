# Section 5 : Developer skills & editor setup

## Section Intro
* learn how to learn to code, how to think like a dev, how to debug code, and how to set up a professional development environment

## 54. Section Roadmap
* complete all sections

## 55. Setting up Prettier and VS Code
* Prettier is an opinionated code formatter (it makes decisions about how code should look, and formats everything according to these rules)
  * available as a VS Code extension
  * define prettier as the default formatter & enable format on save
  * [Prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html)
  * configuration can be customized by creating a .prettierrc file
  * [Ignoring files](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#markdown)

* In VS Code, can configure user snippets, that will allow you to automate common operations / create global snippets to insert into your code
  * ex. replace console.log(``) with a snippet!
  * Code > Prefererences > User snippets
  * ⚠️ this isn't working for me (set up log as a console log keyword, but it's not populating the snippet)

## 56. Installing Node.js and Setting up a dev environment
* set up Live Server to reload browser with each update (no more manual reloads!)
